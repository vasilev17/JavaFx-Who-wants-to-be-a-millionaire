# Стани Богат

"Стани Богат" is a Bulgarian version of the famous "Who want's to be a millionaire" game show. This game represents and gives you the wonderful experience you would feel if participating in the actual show. 

(Warning - Bulgarian is the only language available)

## Installation

Runnable file is currently not available so you will need to use git or the download button (on the right) to download the game source code. Afterwards you need to open and run the project via IDE. To do so, set up the run configuration's **main method** to:

```bash
sample.Controllers.Main
```

## Usage
#### The game should feel pretty intuitive, especially if you have watched the show, but I will still explain how to navigate across it.

At first when you launch the game you will see the **Main Menu** screen:

----------------------------------------
Pressing the "Играй" button, located in the **Main Menu**, will take you to the "Обади се на приятел" (Call a friend) screen where you add 3 people which you can call to help you with a question later on. All people you add need to have a sphere-of-knowledge and names:

----------------------------------------
After you have added all of your friends you need to click the "Напред" button and the game will begin!

In the center of your *Play-Screen* you can see the current question asked, under it there are 4 elements containing the answers, whereas on the upper right of the screen is where the *mute button* is located as well as your *lifelines* and *progress tracker*.

----------------------------------------

If you answer a question wrong you will jump down in progress to the last *"safety net"*. If you decide to *"take your money"* you will keep your progress and not lose any money. In both situations you will be taken to the *end-game-screen*:

----------------------------------------
If you are on the **Main Menu**. "Добави въпрос" is going to take you to a table which has all the questions in the current **database**:

----------------------------------------
You can press the "Назад" button to go back to the **Main Menu** or "Добави" to add a question to your **local database**:

Adding a question means that you have a chance of encountering it later on in the game.
